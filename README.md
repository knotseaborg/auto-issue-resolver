# Beyond Bootstrapping: Automatic resolution of issues in large-scale GitHub repositories.
GPT-4 has been proven to be effective at bootstrapping software projects, but can it be used to maintain complex, large-scale projects? This project is an attempt at creating a tool capable of such a feat.

## How it (should) works!

The goal is to leverage GPT-4 to generate code by
1. Understanding issue raised.
2. Generate a solution

## A closer look at the setup
1. Code graph generation
2. Seting up multiple test environments for parallel resolution of multple issues.
